# Changelog

### 2.0.3 (TBD)

- Feature: There is now an extension mechanism where you can tell Telepresence about different agents and what arguments they support.  The new `--mechanism` flag can explicitly identify which extension to use.
- Change: Related to things now being in extensions, the `--match` flag has been renamed to `--http-match`.
- Change: Cluster connection timeout has been increased from 10s to 20s.
- Bugfix: Fix a regression in the DNS resolver that prevented name resolution using NAME.NAMESPACE. Instead, NAME.NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local was required.
- Bugfix: Fixed race-condition in the agent causing attempts to dial to `:0:`.

### 2.0.2 (February 18, 2021)

- Feature: Telepresence is now capable of forwarding the intercepted Pod's volume mounts (as Telepresence 0.x did) via the `--mount` flag to `telepresence intercept`.
- Feature: Telepresence will now allow simultaneous intercepts in different namespaces.
- Feature: It is now possible for a user to limit what namespaces that will be used by the DNS-resolver and the NAT.
- Bugfix: Fix the kubectl version number check to handle version numbers with a "+" in them.
- Bugfix: Fix a bug with some configurations on macOS where we clash with mDNSResponder's use of port 53.

### 2.0.1 (February 9, 2021)

- Feature: Telepresence is now capable of forwarding the environment variables of an intercepted service (as Telepresence 0.x did) and emit them to a file as text or JSON. The environment variables will also be propagated to any command started by doing a `telepresence intercept nnn -- <command>`.

- Change: The background processes `connector` and `daemon` will now use rotating logs and a common directory.
  + MacOS: `~/Library/Logs/telepresence/`
  + Linux: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/telepresence/logs/` or `$HOME/.cache/telepresence/logs/`.

- Bugfix: A bug causing a failure in the Telepresence DNS resolver when attempting to listen to the Docker gateway IP was fixed. The fix affects Windows using a combination of Docker and WSL2 only.

- Bugfix: Telepresence now works correctly while OpenVPN is running on macOS.
